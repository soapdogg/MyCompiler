# MyCompiler

Simple compiler written for a strict subset of the C programming language. Takes in a file of C source code and transforms it into 'three-address-code' which is still written in C. I honestly just want to work on some project that is simple and laid back before I start working full time.  

## Getting Started

Pull the repo into your dev environment and open the project in Visual Studio.

### Prerequisites

I highly encourage using Visual Studio for development as it will make life easier in the long run.

## Running the tests

Run the test in the Visual Studio test runner. This project has a combination of unit tests and integration tests. 

## Built With

* C# Programming language.
